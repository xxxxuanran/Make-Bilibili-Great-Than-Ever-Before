# Make Bilibili Great Than Ever Before

The name came from one of [Donald J. Trump's 2024 Presidential Campaign Slogan](http://web.archive.org/web/20241213152433/https://www.npr.org/2024/06/20/g-s1-4833/trump-too-big-to-rig-drill-baby-swamp-the-vote-rally-maga-2024). The project is a fork of [Make Bilibili Great Again](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/415714-make-bilibili-great-again) but rewritten in TypeScript, trying some experimental features and experimental APIs.
